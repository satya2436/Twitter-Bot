<h2>Inspiration:</h2>
<li>The dominance of human users as the primary generators of Internet traffic is coming to an end. In 2016, bots generated more Internet traffic than humans. A bot is a piece of software that completes automated tasks over the Internet. On social media, the prevalence of bots is ubiquitous. By some estimates, nearly 48 million Twitter accounts are automated. The ability to detect bot accounts on social media sites like Twitter is important for a healthy information exchange ecosystem.</li>

<h2>Problem description:</h2>
<li>Identifying problematic bots will allow Twitter users to be shielded by groups that aim to affect the perception of how entities and events are actually being perceived by
Twitter’s user base. This can lead to users having a skewed perception of the events around them. When working together in large clusters, bots have the ability to push
narratives that could be false and misleading.  Studies suggest that in the months leading up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, a fifth of all tweets on Twitter that were related to the election came from a legion of bot accounts. Taking up a large percentage of the political discourse in a well-travelled setting, these bots had a large effect on the Presidential Election by refracting the natural conversations of the issues and events surrounding it.</li>

<h2>Solution:</h2>
<li>On Twitter, information can be gained about a user from their personal account information, tweets, likes, retweets, and direct messages. Users’ direct messages are
not accessible for privacy reasons. To identify bots, I set up three basic areas for analysis: profile, account activity, and text mining..</li>
<h2>Working progress:</h2>
<li> We need to Gather the twitter Accounts information </li>
<li>We the Account Description of a twitter account has more property matching with one of the bot it is will put a level on that account as 1 else 0.</li>
<h2>Advantage:</h2>
<li>a healthy information exchange ecosystem.</li>
<li>Avoiding narratives that could be false and misleading.</li>
</h2>Future Scope:</h2>
<li>Looking to Automate the whole task, we need to just feed the twitter account API.</li>


<h2>Limitations:</h2>
<li>As the change in behaviour and profile description of the bots are becoming more like a real account it sometimes fails to detect the bot.</li>
